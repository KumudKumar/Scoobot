Hardware:

ESP32-CAM Module: Used for capturing images and video for face detection.

NodeMCU (ESP8266): For handling communication with external APIs (social media).

Arduino: For handling low-level I/O operations, motors, and sensors.

Software:

Face Detection: Using OpenCV or an inbuilt algorithm to detect human faces.

Social Media Integration: APIs to send the captured face image to social media platforms and compare against public profiles.

Database: Use an external service like Firebase to store previously detected faces and matched identities.

Security Features: The robot will take action (e.g., alerting, storing images, or even locking/unlocking doors).
